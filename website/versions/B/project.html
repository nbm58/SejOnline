      <h1>Project Overview</h1>
      <hr class="titleDivider">
      <h2>
        Original gaming projects are difficult to come by. As a result, there has been a wave of games re-imagined from their
earlier versions, such as Doom ported to console or, more recently, the O.G.R.E. board game brought to life as a
computer game. The latter, it is noted, is based on a book and was part of a wave of board games based on Sci-fi
stories, such as Avalon Hill’s Starship Troopers (based on the Robert Heinlein novel). Bringing these games to
computers and console is valuable for nostalgia, for introducing older games to a fresh audience, and to give
development teams new material on which to sharpen their skills.
In that spirit, I would like to revive a fairly straight-forward non-monetized gambling game from 1980. In that year,
author C. J. Cherryh wrote Serpent’s Reach and created a fictional game called Sej that she used as a plot point in
the novel. At the end of the novel, she provided the rules for the game, which fans used and found simple but
interesting to play. The rules as provided by the author, with a couple of additional notes, are provided as an appendix
to this proposal.

        The requirements for this project can be split up into the following four categories:
        <ul>
          <li>Sej Rules Implemented</li>
          <li>Simple but Attractive Graphics and UI</li>
          <li>Network Connected Two-Player Mode</li>
          <li>User Accounts with Cumulative Score-Keeping</li>
        </ul>
        The above requirements were identified through the process of requirements acquisiton.
        This consisted of multiple meetings with the sponsor and frequent discussion of the project amongst the members of the group.

      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <hr class="titleDivider">
      <h2>
        Our solution is an improved version of the version of Sej that our client created.
        In order to accomplish this goal we plan to implement the following:
        <ul>
          <li>A graphical overhaul that properly simulates dice and wand rolls.</li>
          <li>An improved user interface that better communicates relevant information related to the player’s score and actions.</li>
          <li>An online two-player mode that allows individuals to play with each other no matter how far apart they are.</li>
          <li>A way to keep track of how many games a player has won so that they can show others and keep track of how much they have improved.</li>
        </ul>
